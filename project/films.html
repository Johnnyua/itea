                                Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space opera film
                                directed by George Lucas and
                                written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. The sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999), it is the
                                fifth film in the Star Wars film
                                series and second chronological chapter of the "Skywalker Saga". The film stars Ewan
                                McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden
                                Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny
                                Baker, and Frank Oz.

                                The story is set ten years after The Phantom Menace, as thousands of planetary systems
                                slowly secede from the Galactic
                                Republic and join the newly-formed Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by former
                                Jedi Master Count Dooku. With the
                                galaxy on the brink of civil war, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a mysterious assassination
                                attempt on Senator Padmé
                                Amidala, which leads him to uncover a clone army in service of the Republic and the
                                truth behind the Separatist
                                movement. Meanwhile, his apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect Amidala and
                                develops a secret relationship
                                with her. Soon, the trio witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy: the Clone
                                Wars.

                                Development of Attack of the Clones began in March 2000, some months after the release
                                of The Phantom Menace. By June
                                2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script, and principal photography took
                                place from June to September 2000.
                                The film crew primarily shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Australia, with
                                additional footage filmed in Tunisia,
                                Spain, and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a
                                high-definition digital 24-frame system.

                                The film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews,
                                with some critics hailing it as
                                an improvement over its predecessor The Phantom Menace and others considering it the
                                worst installment of the franchise.
                                The film was praised for an increased emphasis on action, visual effects, musical score,
                                costume design, and the
                                performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Lee, and Oz, but criticized for the screenplay,
                                Anakin's characterization, romantic
                                scenes, and underdeveloped characters. It performed well at the box office, making over
                                $645 million worldwide; however,
                                it became the first Star Wars film to be outgrossed in its year of release, placing
                                third domestically after Spider-Man
                                and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide after
                                the latter two films and Harry
                                Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[3] Revenge of the Sith (2005) followed Attack of the
                                Clones, concluding the Star Wars
                                prequel trilogy.

                                Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 American epic space opera film
                                written and directed by George
                                Lucas. It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid,
                                Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee,
                                Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz. The sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999) and
                                Attack of the Clones (2002), it
                                is the sixth film in the Star Wars film series, the final installment in the Star Wars
                                prequel trilogy, and third
                                chronological chapter of the "Skywalker Saga".

                                Revenge of the Sith is set three years after the onset of the Clone Wars as established
                                in Attack of the Clones. The
                                Jedi are spread across the galaxy in a full-scale war against the Separatists. The Jedi
                                Council dispatches Obi-Wan
                                Kenobi on a mission to defeat General Grievous, the head of the Separatist army, to put
                                an end to the war. Meanwhile,
                                after having visions of his wife Padmé Amidala dying in childbirth, Anakin Skywalker is
                                tasked by the Council to spy on
                                Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, secretly, a Sith Lord.
                                Palpatine manipulates Anakin into
                                turning to the dark side of the Force and becoming his apprentice, Darth Vader, with
                                wide-ranging consequences for the
                                galaxy.

                                Lucas began writing the script before production of Attack of the Clones ended, citing
                                that he wanted the end of the
                                trilogy to have similar aspects to a romantic tragedy, thus building into Darth Vader's
                                state at the beginning of the
                                next film. Production of Revenge of the Sith started in September 2003, and filming took
                                place in Australia with
                                additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom.

                                The film is set 19 years after the formation of the Galactic Empire and the events of
                                Revenge of the Sith; construction
                                has finished on the Death Star, a weapon capable of destroying a planet. After Princess
                                Leia Organa, a leader of the
                                Rebel Alliance, receives the weapon's plans in the hope of finding a weakness, she is
                                kidnapped and taken to the Death
                                Star. Meanwhile, a young farmer named Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has lived
                                in seclusion for years on the

                                The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back)
                                is a 1980 American epic space
                                opera film directed by Irvin Kershner from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence
                                Kasdan, based on a story by
                                George Lucas. The sequel to Star Wars (1977),[b] it is the second film in the Star Wars
                                film series and the fifth
                                chronological chapter of the "Skywalker Saga". Set three years after the events of Star
                                Wars, the film recounts the
                                battle between the malevolent Galactic Empire, led by the Emperor, and the Rebel
                                Alliance, led by Princess Leia. Luke
                                Skywalker trains to master the Force so he can confront the powerful Sith lord, Darth
                                Vader. The ensemble cast includes
                                Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David
                                Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew,
                                and Frank Oz.

                                Following the success of Star Wars, Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. Following
                                her death in 1978, he outlined
                                the whole Star Wars saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring Raiders of the
                                Lost Ark (1981) writer Kasdan to
                                enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing Star Wars, Lucas handed this
                                responsibility to Kershner and
                                focused on expanding his special effects company Industrial Light & Magic instead.
                                Filmed from March to September 1979
                                in Finse, Norway, and at Elstree Studios in England, The Empire Strikes Back faced
                                production difficulties, including
                                actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs
                                rose. Initially budgeted at $8
                                million, costs had risen to $30.5 million by the project's conclusion.

                                Return of the Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi) is a 1983
                                American epic space opera film
                                directed by Richard Marquand. The screenplay is by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas from
                                a story by Lucas, who was also
                                the executive producer. The sequel to Star Wars (1977)[a] and The Empire Strikes Back
                                (1980), it is the third
                                installment in the original Star Wars trilogy, the third film to be produced, and the
                                sixth chronological film in the
                                "Skywalker Saga". The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee
                                Williams, Anthony Daniels, David
                                Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz.

                                Set one year after The Empire Strikes Back, the Galactic Empire is constructing a second
                                Death Star to exterminate the
                                Rebel Alliance. With intel that the Emperor will be onboard, the Rebel Fleet launches a
                                full-scale attack on the Death
                                Star in hopes of both destroying it and the Emperor. Meanwhile, Rebel hero Luke
                                Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, struggles
                                to bring his father, Darth Vader, back to the light side of the Force.

                                Following Lucas and Kasdan's discussion on making Return of the Jedi, the film went into
                                production. Steven Spielberg,
                                David Lynch and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the project before Marquand
                                signed on as director. The
                                production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the
                                shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan,
                                Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas
                                to construct it. Kazanjian's
                                schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light & Magic
                                more time to work on the film's
                                effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from
                                January to May 1982.
